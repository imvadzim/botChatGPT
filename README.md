# botChatGPT

This code sets up a Telegram bot that can answer questions using the OpenAI API.

First, the code imports the necessary modules: telebot for working with the Telegram Bot API, and openai for accessing the OpenAI API. Then, the OpenAI API key is set up using the provided API key.

Next, a new Telegram bot is created using the token provided.

After that, a function is defined using a decorator to handle incoming messages. The function is called answer_question and it takes a message argument, which represents the message sent by the user. This function uses the OpenAI API to generate a response to the user's question by passing the message text to the openai.Completion.create() method. The engine parameter is set to "text-davinci-003", which is the name of the OpenAI model to use for generating the response. Other parameters are also passed to control the generation process, such as max_tokens to limit the length of the response, n to specify the number of responses to generate, and temperature to control the "creativity" of the response.

Finally, the response generated by the OpenAI API is sent back to the user via the Telegram bot using the bot.send_message() method. The message.chat.id argument specifies the ID of the chat where the message originated, and response.choices[0].text retrieves the text of the first response generated by the OpenAI API.

The bot is started using bot.polling(), which continuously listens for new messages and calls the appropriate message handler function.
